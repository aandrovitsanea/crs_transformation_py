# Tranformation between coordinate reference systems with python

### This is a simple application of [pyproj tools](https://pypi.org/project/pyproj/) that performs transformations between coordinate reference systems. 

### It is currently implemented for Greek Grid 1987 (EPSG2100) and WGS84, which are very handy for a project in Greek territory.

### Transformation is performed for itemized sets of coordinates as well as for a dataframe with multiple points, therefore sets of X,Y.

#### The script is incorporated in a jupyter notebook. Additinally, a simple set of coordinates is included as a .csv file for testing.
